## Task
This Python script performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a wine dataset using various data visualization techniques. Here's what the script does:
Loading Dataset: The script loads the wine dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
Cleaning Dataset: It cleans the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns, converting data types, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
Data Visualization:
Histogram: Visualizes the distribution of wine ratings across different countries using a bar plot. Pie Chart: Illustrates the distribution of the top 10 countries contributing to the dataset. Scatter Plot: Displays the relationship between wine ratings and years. Pairplot and Heatmap: Shows the correlation between different features using pairplot and heatmap. Required Libraries:
scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
## Description
This Python script performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a wine dataset. The dataset contains information about various attributes of wines such as country, points, price, variety, and winery. The script utilizes popular Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the dataset.
The main functionalities of the script include:
Loading the dataset from a CSV file. Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Generating visualizations such as histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, pairplots, and heatmaps to explore the relationships between different features and gain insights into the dataset. Providing flexibility to modify the script for additional analysis or customization based on specific requirements. Key Features:
Visualizing the distribution of wine ratings across different countries. Analyzing the contribution of top countries to the dataset. Exploring the relationship between wine ratings and years. Investigating correlations between different features using pairplots and heatmaps.
## Installation
Before running the code, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip (Python's package installer) if you haven't already:
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Make sure you have these packages installed. They are necessary for executing the code successfully. Additionally, ensure that you have a Python environment set
up. You can create a virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively.
## Usage
Install Dependencies: pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Once the script is executed, it will generate various visualizations depicting the exploratory data analysis of the wine dataset.
Explore histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, pairplots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the dataset.
Analyze the relationships between different features and their correlations.
Modify the Script (Optional):

You can modify the script to include additional analysis or customize visualizations based on your requirements.
Experiment with different parameters or algorithms to further explore the dataset.
