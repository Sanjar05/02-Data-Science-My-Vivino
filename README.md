<hr>
<p>My Vivino is an online marketplace. We have a vast wine database, and we have 27 million users, mainly in North America.</p>
<p>One of our leading services is a wine recommendation system. It starts to be a little old. Rules-based. We are selling wine based on our customer visit/research.</p>
<p>You've just finished a meeting with your product manager. Data science is the future, and our competitor <code>my_wine.com</code> has invested a lot in it.</p>
<p>Following your suggestion, my_vivino's CEO has decided to allocate a budget to move forward on the data science project you've proposed.</p>
<p><em>Which project?</em></p>
<p>What are the success criteria?</p>
<ul>
<li>During our next meeting, you will have to show us some data (plot? report?) of what you've been building.</li>
<li>Impact on the business. We need to make our customers happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>What to expect?</p>
<ul>
<li>Slides presentation.</li>
<li>And the DevOps team should be able to push it to production.</li>
</ul>
<p>You've heard the CEO will be joining the meeting. It's a reminder if you do well, you can quickly expect the promotion you are expecting.</p>
<h2>Technical specification</h2>
<p>What is to be a Data Scientist?</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Collecting / Cleaning</li>
<li>Data Exploration</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Communication</li>
</ol>
<p>You will have to prove yourself in each of these. We are confident you've already done it! :)</p>
<p>Where to find the data?
Any where. Scrap Vivino / Bevmo / Delectable / Wine-Searcher / ...</p>
<p>It's an open project. You are free to find something you find will be useful to do some data analysis on:</p>
<ul>
<li>rating system?</li>
<li>comments system? detect most valuable comments?</li>
<li>wine suggestion?</li>
<li>wine classification?</li>
<li>wine quality?</li>
<li>size of the market analysis?</li>
<li>suggestion base on a meal recipe?</li>
</ul>
<p>Reminder, it will be one of your portfolio projects. You can find a lot of different ideas. Plagiarism is not tolerated in the company either here. :-)
If you don't find enough information on wine, why not moving to the Whisky market, Beer market, or Coca? any beverage market? :-)</p>
<p>You are in data <strong>science</strong>, so your blog post needs to report as a "scientific experiment"; you need to write your assumption, every step of the experiment, and the conclusion.
Usually, with an opening to what you follow, what to experiment next?</p>
<p>The scope is vast. You will find your idea :)</p>
<p>How will this project be graded?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your code</li>
<li>Your code quality</li>
<li>Your slides quality</li>
<li>Business impact</li>
<li>Your blog post (You can inspire yourself from this fascinating <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/05/my-exciting-journey-into-kubernetes-history/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Kubernetes.)</li>
</ul>
